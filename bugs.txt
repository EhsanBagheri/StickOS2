firmware history:
  v2.27  (0x0) initial release
  v2.27a (0x4eec) add flash checksum
  v2.27b (0x45bf) fix flash upgrade, implement uart pin vars
  v2.27c (0x50c0) fix JTAG stealing E3/TDO after flash upgrade
  v2.27d (0x423c) switch ADC to 12-bit mode; bump flash calibration values by 4x
  v2.27e (0x2a37) disable pullups on pins a0-a8 because they seem incompatible with ADC scanning
  v2.27f (0x55c1) add "ver" command
  v2.27g (0x7c8e) prep for release

known bugs with current release (v2.27g)
  weak pull-up resistors (7k-22k) are enabled on logic analyzer inputs by default (which can interfere with i2c)
  uart read/write of basic array garbles/duplicates data

board history:
  2.27f production runs enig spacing
  2.27g elecrow bnc/usb change
  2.27h experimental QFP board (with unintentional paste under QFP)
  2.27i experimental QFP board with no paste under QFP

test:
  confirm checksum
  full pcba turn-on, including testbed, persistent calibration
  toaster
  simon
  breadboard, including i2c display
  uart console, uart loopbacks, uart to scope
  spi ledstrip, display
  all pins analog and digital and pwm
  flash upgrade to debug and -g and back
  test windows, linux, android, mac, chromebook

board:
  for qfp, replace pic32 and remove mask from flag in pcb
  consider adding selectable input prescalers?  SPI Digital POT?
  add 1k resistor in voltage follower feedback loop?
  change 3pF load cap to 6.8pF to get broader compensation support
  move switches so no interference when bending panel board to separate?  move mlcc's farther from board edge?
  vbus should be connected -- errata shows 10k/20k (1%) divider needed.
  switch to usb C vonnector
  shrink board and remove qfp support

todo arch:
  move calibration from webpage to firmware, so "scope" returns calibrated data directly and trigger levels use calibrated data

todo html:
  calibration values should be stored per-volt, and we should allow calibrations at other then 3.3V
  allow "measure" button to drag crosshairs (rather than place dot)
  allow display resize
  horizontal scrolling of trace on chromebook does not work :-(
  have measure divisions or sample grid for manual clock recovery
  (persistent) labels for binary bits?
  should we have an option for deep scrollable capture, using all of ram?
  deeper trace and fft display?
  option to export/import raw data?
  should we have two separate line segments on oor so we don't show red coming up or down the trace?
  should we have 1 line segment rather than 2 when doing horizontal magnification?
  need js functions to go forward and backward from calibration, and tests that they are reversible!
  aliasing at right and left vertical marker vs. signal

todo StickOS:
  allow waveform amplitude to be changed -- have separate const table for reference and RAM table in use
  store cal values in modes rather than vars, so unaffected by "new"?
  falling edge trigger level on power supply ripple seems ~0.1V too high?
  scope should have all interrupts (even usb) disabled for the first 1000ms of trigger (delayed ctrl-c)
  add webusb auto load, allow usb stall, https://developer.chrome.com/articles/build-for-webusb/
  add microsoft usb descriptor
  on i2c reset do xxx (possibly just continue)
  allow pin names in upper or lower case
  remove zigflea -- nodeid, remote variables, etc.
  get rid of cpustick/stickos/sources layers
  change all use of MASK to bits!
  implement multi-function mass storage to store flea-scope.html locally
  overclock if s1 not pressed on boot?  20 Msps?
  download and clone?
  test "out of variables"
  pullups for all unused/disconnected pins -- not near analog sample pins!!!
  rc10 should be driven low when wave is not in use
  heartbeat led does not blink while waiting for trigger (well, yeah)
  get rid of 80 character line limit?

todo SickOS general:
dim a$[10]; a$="hello"; uart 2 write a does the wrong thing and sends "hhhhhhhhhh" instead of "hello"
do we need to add a test for uart tx/rx interrupts? (on uart x input/output do)
allow gosub to use string expression instead of a label -- gosub state$
do we need more tests for returning from gosub with open scopes?  if, for, etc.
add "eval" command?  add case/switch command?
allow heartbeat and safemode* on same pin (resistor with switch)!
get rid of all code in #defines -- esp ?: and such for flash generations
get rid of all (*xxx)++ references
uniq -d long lines (if, else, while, etc.)
merge const parsing
allow upper case letters in hex addresses.
add "upload" command to turn BASIC programs into S19/HEX...

// prior 1
// =======
// make run_var() extern and add to run.h!
// add windows/linux build to skeleton project
// "step" and "trace" should be statements, not commands!
// configure/on timer (n) should be able to take variables for (n)
// # on string should still return max len -- @ should return consumed length! (or swap!)
// eliminate restrictions on "analog" mode values.  "servo", too?
// add "configure qspi baud (n) mode (0-3)"
// add "configure i2c baud (n)"
// allow "library" sub in "library" to create global variables somehow.  call this by convention to initialize library.
// allow you to set stop bits in the "configure" statement; switch all to 1 stop bit!
// stickos should report uart framing errors and overrun errors more gracefully!  on uart 1 error do gosub recover
// I should probably allow "as byte" or "as word" on pin variables, but I don't currently.
// get rid of parse2/run2/basic0 if we make stickos source public?
// pins should survive upgrade; same for nodeid, ipaddress, etc.
// do we want BASIC to have control over pull-ups?  thru a mode variable?
// multi-pin variables (digital I/O only, using binary integer)!!!
// add packed save/load commands!!!; make flash filesystem allocate only as much space as is needed to save a current program!
// on/off/mask/unmask should move to parse2.c/run2.c
// Ctrl-E to dump all variables while basic program is running?
// add ability to get stack trace with locals from all frames
// test i2c with sda, scl, sda and acl all tied to ground -- no hangs or crashes.

// add getchar example in ug?  don't use getchar$
// remove refs to keychar$ and getchar$!
// add digital input and analog output example
// add minimum flash requirements for pic32 and 5225x to mcu details
// document "conflicting timer usage"
// MCU details says "autorun disable", but we are inconsistent in docs with use of "safemode*"
// update user's guide to indicate keychar and getchar automatically reset to 0 after they are read.

// prior 2

// fgure out a clean way for spi/i2c to steal pins
// expose erase_page and write_word to basic to manipulate other half of flash!
// allow input of negative numbers
// give vprint ability to do sign extension?
// consider doing servos in sw w/ lightweight isr rather than using hw timers
// add "modes" to turn off USB and QSPI and get their pins back for gpio

// need a second catalog page for safe updates!
